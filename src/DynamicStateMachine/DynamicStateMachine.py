class DynamicStateMachine:
    """ A state machine that has dynamic transitions between states. It requires an initial state, a
    reference to the States subclass, and a list of transitions. Transitions can be either a simple
    state transition (one state to the next), or a method that will be called to determine the next
    state.

    Methods in this class used as transitions must return one of the following:
        - A member of the States subclass
        - Another transition method of this class that follows the same rules
        - None, to indicate the end of the state machine

    Rules for transitions:
        - Each state should only be on the left hand side (be transitioned from) once (enforced, but not warned)
        - Methods on the right hand side must be methods of this class's subclass, and not standalone functions (this is enforced at the moment)
        - Infinite loops function, and may be intentional, and thus are not checked for
        - Infinite virtual loops (a cycle of all virtual States) will result in a max recursion error. This is not checked for explicitly

    Side effects can be defined using methods named according to the following:
        - before_<step>
        - after_<step>
        - on_<step>
        - on_start
        - on_end2
